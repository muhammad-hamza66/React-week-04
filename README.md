React Routing & Authentication Project

This project is a practice application where I learned and implemented:

React Router for navigation

Nested Routes for organizing components within layouts

Protected Routes to restrict access to authenticated users

Login Authentication with basic login/logout functionality

Simple Todo Application integrated with routing

🚀 Features

Login & Logout: Users must log in to access protected pages.

Protected Routes: Certain pages are accessible only after authentication.

Nested Routes: Demonstrates child routes inside a parent layout.

Todo App: Add, view, and manage simple tasks.

Navigation: Implemented using react-router-dom.
